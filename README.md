# <center >MIPS processor in single cycle architecture</center>

## What does it do?

The MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor is a simplified and efficient example of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture. It features a fixed-length 32-bit instruction format, a small set of 32 general-purpose registers, and emphasizes register-based operations. Its pipelined architecture enhances instruction throughput, and it is widely used in embedded systems, networking devices, and early workstations for its balanced and efficient performance. In this project we performed the ALU operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the `Single Cycle architecture`
